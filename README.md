SARI is an R/Shiny app that allows you to visualise discrete time series data, analyse them individually, fit unidimensional models interactively and save the results using a web interface.

SARI has been developed in the R programming language, under the interactive framework of the Shiny R package.  
Currently tested in R version 4.1.0.

SARI can be used:  
- remotelly from the shinyapps server at this link https://alvarosg.shinyapps.io/sari
- locally on your machine using a prebuilt Docker image available at https://hub.docker.com/r/alvarosg/sari  
- locally on your machine using the source code and after installing R, RStudio and all the R dependencies given in the [INSTALL](INSTALL) file.  

The [about.pdf](/www/about.pdf) file contains all the details to run SARI including the description of all functionalities.  
This file is accessed from the main interface on the `Help` button or locally in the /www directory.
