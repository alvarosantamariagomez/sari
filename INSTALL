Instructions for Installing R and RStudio 
------------------------------------------

To install R, follow the instructions from the official R documentation here
https://cran.r-project.org/

If using Windows: Rtools needs to be installed following these instructions
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

If using MacOS: Xcode and a GNU Fortran compiler may be necessary in order to install some packages.
https://mac.r-project.org/tools/

Finally, it is recommended to install Rstudio (free desktop version) from
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Both R and RStudio are available for windows, Linux and MacOS.
 
With R and RStudio installed, you need to install a number of packages before running SARI.

Install all the packages indicated below and their dependencies from CRAN.
If using Windows, in order to use Rtools, you need first to install and load the package devtools:
`library(devtools)`

There are two ways of installing packages in Rstudio:

1) Go to Tools -> Install Packages. The following packages can be installed at once from CRAN by adding their names separated by spaces or commas:
`data.table, dlm, fields, lubridate, magrittr, markdown, matrixStats, numDeriv, psych, RColorBrewer, shinyBS, shinycssloaders, shinyjs, shinythemes, shiny, spectral, strucchange, tseries`

2) On the R console, the following command will install the packages at once:
`install.packages(c("data.table", "dlm", "fields", "lubridate", "magrittr", "markdown", "matrixStats", "numDeriv", "psych", "RColorBrewer", "shinyBS", "shinycssloaders", "shinyjs", "shinythemes", "shiny", "spectral", "strucchange", "tseries"))`

In addition, the package "mvcwt" needs to be downloaded and compiled from here:
https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/mvcwt/
To install this package, simply go to Tools -> Install Packages and select the downloaded tar.gz file.

The list below shows the package versions used when accessing SARI from Docker or the online server:

  (data.table) #v1.14.2
  (dlm) #v1.1-5
  (fields) #v13.3
  (lubridate) #v1.8.0
  (magrittr) #v2.0.3
  (markdown) #v1.1
  (matrixStats) #v0.61.0
  (mvcwt) #v1.3.1
  (numDeriv) #v2016.8-1.1
  (psych) #v2.1.9
  (RColorBrewer) #v1.1-2
  (shinyBS) #v0.61
  (shinycssloaders) #v1.0.0.9000
  (shinyjs) #v2.0
  (shinythemes) #v1.2.0
  (shiny) #v1.7.2
  (spectral) #v2.0
  (strucchange) #v1.5-2
  (tseries) #v0.10-49
  (pracma) #v2.3.8

If the installed shinycssloaders package is not version 1.0.0.9 (or later), you need to install this version from the github repo using
`devtools::install_github("daattali/shinycssloaders")`

Once all the packages are installed, open the app.R script with RStudio.
Set the working directory to the same location.
Then click on RunApp (run external) or go to Code -> Source or push Ctrl+Shift+S.

Enjoy!
